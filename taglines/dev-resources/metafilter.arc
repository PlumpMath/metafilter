In 1972, the anime action-adventure show <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx0vhpG3lLc"><i>Kagaku ninja tai Gatchaman</i></a> (<i>Science Ninja Team Gatchaman,</i>) premiered on Japanese television. Featuring graphic violence, extensive profanity and a transgendered <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/87987/Zoltar-Segue">villain</a>, it was one of the most popular animated series of its time. Envisioning similar success in the US, <a href="http://www.sandyfrankentertainment.com/index.php">Sandy Frank Entertainment</a> acquired the series in 1978 but deemed it too graphic and shocking for domestic audiences.  So they hired two Hanna-Barbera vets to &quot;<a href="http://www.sandyfrankentertainment.com/overview.php"><strike>re-version</strike></a>&quot; totally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Planets#Key_changes_in_the_adaptation">bowdlerize</a> the episodes with new scripts, voiceovers music and effects, animation, etc., at a cost of $5 million and turn it into a brand new show: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acOnskcyrtA"><i>Battle of the Planets</i></a>.  Here are the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/X0oMALKAVo0X#grid/user/C63087CCC4202B1C">original 1978 <em>Battle of the Planets</em> feature film (in 7 parts,)</a> and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/X0oMALKAVo0X#grid/user/60AAEDA4C49A580A">first 19 episodes of the show,</a> all available on Youtube.<div style="border-top:1px dotted #777;margin-top:6px;padding-right:20px;" /><br>CBR: <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16367">GATCHAMAN!

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjuN5Bn-RCo">Gatchaman Opening in Japanese with theme song by</a> <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=23303">Masato</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masato_Shimon">Shimon</a>, who is also known for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xxjnVH7izw">his unique rendition of the theme to Star Wars</a>.  Partial <a href="http://altjapan.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/06/sutaa_uoozu.html">translation of the lyrics</a>.<br />
<br />
Per <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076983/trivia">IMDB</a>, the show was originally marketed to capitalize on the first <i>Star Wars</i> movie.   Voice artists on <em>Battle of the Planets</em> included <a href="http://www.mister-ed.tv/">Alan Young</a> and Kasey Casem.<br />
<br />
Japanese Episodes of <em>Gatchaman I</em> and two series sequels: <em>Gatchaman II</em> and <em>Gatchaman Fighter</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/0yulka0#p/u/0/qLzo_wJ_5ms">have been uploaded by user 0yulka0</a>   (no playlist).  <small>These are in Japanese.  Many have English or Korean subtitles. The differences between the two shows should be immediately obvious.</small><br />
<br />
A number of episodes of Toonami’s 1986 “G-Force Guardians of Space” <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperAdventures#g/c/9DDB3A1B21EAA6D2">can also be seen on Youtube</a>. <br />

<u>Movie</u><br />
In 2009, Hong Kong studio Imagi released <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBP2WI6H6-Y&feature=related">a pre-production trailer for a feature-length Science Ninja Team Gatchaman movie</a>.   More <a href="http://www.imagi.com.hk/web/eng/coming-soon/gatchaman.html">info</a> and further <a href="http://gatchablog.blogspot.com/2010/08/more-about-imagis-gatchaman-teaser.html">details</a>   Another trailer, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQUUcB3vbsw">showing a different entirely CG style</a>, was released in 2007. The studio folded / restructured last year and <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/gatchaman-trailer-a-look-at-a-movie-we-may-never-see/">the movie’s fate is unknown</a>.  <br />
<br />
<u>Oy Vey</u><br />
One of the changes to the show (in an effort to fill airtime after the original cartoons had been gutted by SFE,) was the addition of cheesy clips starring a robot “narrator” for the team, (whose primary purpose seemed to be explaining to the viewing audience that &quot;no one got hurt&quot; or died,) named <a href="http://dreamerscovestudio.com/botp/zark.html">7-Zark-7</a> who <a href="http://www.chronicsite.com/gatchaman/Mania/101Uses.html">doesn’t get much love from some fans</a>. <br />
<br />
<u>Last But Not Least</u><br />
The site for <a href="http://www.taiyo-slot.co.jp/gatchaman/">Taiyo’s Gatchaman-themed slot machine</a> is entirely in Japanese, but rather well done.</div>

<br />
Years later, when I found the Gatchaman 94 DVD, I was ecstatic.  Popped it in, and was absolutely pleased.<br />
<br />
And then there was a piece of music that showed up - in the show, and in Gatchaman 94, it was the &quot;flying ship cruising through the sky&quot; music, and that happened, and I was six again.<br />

<br />
It's not like it was something I ever had a huge fondness for, really.  I mean, I dug it but it was something that, for some reason, a lot of people who seemed like they would know about it had forgotten, but a lot of people who wouldn't have been into &quot;that sort of thing&quot; seemed to love.   It just turned out if you were going to be a person I want to in my life, you'd respond to the mention with a non-blank face.<br />
<br />
I should write an essay about those 1990s.  It was pretty grand.  As is this post... which will suck away my entire afternoon if I don't escape its orbit.<br />

Well, I sorta waited about 5 minutes. But I've been creating this post for months.<br />
<br />
I finished putting the final touches on it last night after midnight. Thought I'd post it this morning when I had a moment between meetings. If I made 100,000, great.  If not, that would be okay too. <br />
<br />
But I compose all my posts in GoogleDocs.  Which means that I have to leave the links <em>next</em> to the text and then code them on the site afterwards.  If you type quotation marks in GDocs, it makes them &quot;smart&quot; quotes.  Which destroys your html coding.  Speaking of which, does anyone know how to shut that setting off?  Because it's driving me bonkers!<br />
<br />
There are so many links on this post that it took me a<em> lot</em> of time to get it ready. (And the MeFi linkifier has a bug, where when you paste a link and click &quot;ok,&quot; it scrolls to the top of the box. On a post this large, I was constantly scrolling down.) Then I had to tweak the language. Finished about 1:20-ish. Checked the post count... and waited around 5 minutes. ;)<br><span class="smallcopy">posted by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/18312" target="_self">zarq</a> at <a href="/100000/Gatchaman#3488211" target="_self">11:12 AM</a>  on January 28, 2011 </span></div><br><br>

Around 1992 a bunch of us re-watched a bunch of BotP episodes on a VCR bootleg, including the infamous unmasking of Zoltar.  We must have re-played that one line five times, laughing our asses off.  The guy who hosted the party said he was going to put it on his answering machine.<br />

The winged costumes and the acrobatic moves they did with them; the amazing individual weapons and gadgets; the nifty designs of the vehicles, each with it's own special functions, secret-identity &quot;normal&quot; form, and all fitting together into the main ship; the needle on the temperature gauge inching up into the red zone that triggered the Fiery Phoenix; the watches they used to transform; the whirlwind pyramid move; the inventive giant enemies; the confusing Zoltan; the awesome Superfriends-style-Music-and-bombastic-Narrator-turned-up-to-eleven; the attacks from &quot;ALIEN GALAXIES FROM BEYOND SPACE!&quot; -- I'm getting chills just trying to remember them all.<br />
